# This variable allows you to customize the message index display to
# your personal taste.
# 
# ``Format strings'' are similar to the strings used in the C
# function printf(3) to format output (see the man page for more details).
# The following sequences are defined in Mutt:
# %a      address of the author
# %A      reply-to address (if present; otherwise: address of author)
# %b      filename of the original message folder (think mailbox)
# %B      the list to which the letter was sent, or else the folder name (%b).
# %c      number of characters (bytes) in the message
# %C      current message number
# %d      date and time of the message in the format specified by
# $date_format         converted to sender's time zone
# %D      date and time of the message in the format specified by
# $date_format         converted to the local time zone
# %e      current message number in thread
# %E      number of messages in current thread
# %f      sender (address + real name), either From: or Return-Path:
# %F      author name, or recipient name if the message is from you
# %H      spam attribute(s) of this message
# %i      message-id of the current message
# %l      number of lines in the message (does not work with maildir,
#         mh, and possibly IMAP folders)
# %L      If an address in the ``To:'' or ``Cc:'' header field matches an address
#         defined by the users ``subscribe'' command, this displays
#         "To <list-name>", otherwise the same as %F.
# %m      total number of message in the mailbox
# %M      number of hidden messages if the thread is collapsed.
# %N      message score
# %n      author's real name (or address if missing)
# %O      original save folder where mutt would formerly have
#         stashed the message: list name or recipient name
#         if not sent to a list
# %P      progress indicator for the built-in pager (how much of the file has been displayed)
# %s      subject of the message
# %S      status of the message (``N''/``D''/``d''/``!''/``r''/*)
# %t      ``To:'' field (recipients)
# %T      the appropriate character from the $to_chars string
# %u      user (login) name of the author
# %v      first name of the author, or the recipient if the message is from you
# %X      number of attachments
#         (please see the ``attachments'' section for possible speed effects)
# %y      ``X-Label:'' field, if present
# %Y      ``X-Label:'' field, if present, and (1) not at part of a thread tree,
#         (2) at the top of a thread, or (3) ``X-Label:'' is different from
#         preceding message's ``X-Label:''.
# %Z      message status flags
# %{fmt}  the date and time of the message is converted to sender's
#         time zone, and ``fmt'' is expanded by the library function
#         strftime(3); a leading bang disables locales
# %[fmt]  the date and time of the message is converted to the local
#         time zone, and ``fmt'' is expanded by the library function
#         strftime(3); a leading bang disables locales
# %(fmt)  the local date and time when the message was received.
#         ``fmt'' is expanded by the library function strftime(3);
#         a leading bang disables locales
# %<fmt>  the current local time. ``fmt'' is expanded by the library
#         function strftime(3); a leading bang disables locales.
# %>X     right justify the rest of the string and pad with character ``X''
# %|X     pad to the end of the line with character ``X''
# %*X     soft-fill with character ``X'' as pad
# 
# 
# ``Soft-fill'' deserves some explanation: Normal right-justification
# will print everything to the left of the ``%>'', displaying padding and
# whatever lies to the right only if there's room. By contrast,
# soft-fill gives priority to the right-hand side, guaranteeing space
# to display it and showing padding only if there's still room. If
# necessary, soft-fill will eat text leftwards to make room for
# rightward text.
# 
# Note that these expandos are supported in
# ``save-hook'', ``fcc-hook'' and ``fcc-save-hook'', too.

#       function to process the date, see the man page for the proper syntax.
#       
#       Unless the first character in the string is a bang (``!''), the month
#       and week day names are expanded according to the locale specified in
#       the variable $locale. If the first character in the string is a
#       bang, the bang is discarded, and the month and week day names in the
#       rest of the string are expanded in the C locale (that is in US
#       English).
