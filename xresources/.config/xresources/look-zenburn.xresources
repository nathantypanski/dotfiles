   Description:

     This file defines a set of symbolic constants for use in
     application-specific resource files, such as `xterm.xrdb'.

     The values of the constants correspond to the Zenburn color theme
     originally created by Jani Nurminen for Vim.  Jani's color theme,
     in turn, was based on other color themes for Vim, specifically
     BlackDust, Camo, and Desert.

   Usage:

     1. Put this file somewhere in your home directory.  You might
        want to create a separate directory, e.g., `~/.xrdb/', in
        which to put all X resource files.

     2. Put the line `#include "~/.xrdb/look-zenburn.xrdb"' in your
        main X resource file (most likely `~/.Xdefaults' or
        `~/.Xresources').

     3. Obtain or write application-specific X resource files that
        make use of the symbolic constants defined in this file.
        Include these files in your main X resource file *after*
        including this file.

     4. Read the commentary below (particulary the part about fonts).

     5. Restart your X session or run `xrdb -load <resource-file>',
        where <resource-file> is your main X resource file.

     6. Restart the now themed applications.

   Commentary:

     Currently, this file defines

       * foreground and background colors, and

       * the 16 terminal colors.

     It specifically does *not* define fonts, since this preference
     varies heavily among users.  Personally, I have the following two
     lines at the top of my `~/.Xresources' file:

       #define FONT       -*-lucy-medium-*-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*
       #define FONT_BOLD  -*-lucy-bold-*-*-*-10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

     You can find a link to the Lucy font files below.  The Lucy fonts
     currently only come in size 10.  If this is too small for your
     taste, I suggest Lucida Typewriter, from which Lucy is (most
     likely illegally) derived.  Simply substitute `lucidatypewriter'
     for `lucy' and `12' for `10'.

     If you need other constants defined in order to apply this color
     scheme to another application, please let me know.  Likewise, if
     you have written an X resource file that makes use of these
     constants, I'd be delighted to help you distribute it.
