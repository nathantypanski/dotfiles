  # Home Manager needs a bit of information about you and the paths it should

  # compatible with. This helps avoid breakage when a new Home Manager release
  # introduces backwards incompatible changes.

  # want to update the value, then make sure to first check the Home Manager
  # release notes.

    # # "Hello, world!" when run.

    # # It is sometimes useful to fine-tune packages, for example, by applying
    # # overrides. You can do that directly here, just don't forget the
    # # parentheses. Maybe you want to install Nerd Fonts with a limited number of
    # # fonts?
    # (pkgs.nerdfonts.override { fonts = [ "FantasqueSansMono" ]; })

    # # You can also create simple shell scripts directly inside your
    # # configuration. For example, this adds a command 'my-hello' to your
    # # environment:
    # (pkgs.writeShellScriptBin "my-hello" ''
    #   echo "Hello, ${config.home.username}!"
    # '')

  # source

  #
  # or
  #
